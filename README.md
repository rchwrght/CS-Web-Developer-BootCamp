This file is the collection of coursework and challenges provided by the Colt Steele Web Developer Bootcamp tutored through Udemy.

I worked my way through this course between October 2017 to February 2018 before embarking on the more recent follow up course for Advanced Web Developement offered by the same tutor.

The follow-up course is mostly performed on CodePen (www.codepen.io/rchwrght) although as the course developes I will be adding a new repo to hold the course work here on GitHub.
